Hello there ðŸ‘‹. I am a ~~first-year~~ second-year PhD student in [CSE](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/).

My current research focuses on uncertainty quantification for scientific machine learning. I am advised by [Peng Chen](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~pchen402/index.html).
